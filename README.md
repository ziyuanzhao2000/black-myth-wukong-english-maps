### Black Myth: Wukong Map Translation Project

#### [The Maps Are Here](https://ziyuanzhao2000.github.io/black-myth-wukong-english-maps/)

#### Overview
[Black Myth: Wukong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/) is a highly anticipated action RPG that has garnered significant attention since its release. However, the game currently lacks an in-game map, which has been a point of frustration for many new players (see [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1eu51nc/lack_of_a_map/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMythWukong/comments/1ewo4wc/if_the_first_update_doesnt_add_a_map_to_this_game/)). To address this, we've undertaken the task of translating and hosting maps from the [Gamersky website](https://www.gamersky.com/tools/map/wukong/?mapId=4), providing an English version to assist players in navigating the game's world.

#### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to offer an accessible and user-friendly map solution for English-speaking players of "Black Myth: Wukong." By translating the existing maps and presenting them in a clear, interactive format using Plotly.express, we aim to enhance the gaming experience and help players better explore and enjoy the game.

#### How It Works
* Reverse Engineering: We fetched the resources from Gamersky's map website and created a local database. We hope to keep them updated regularly.
* Map Translation: We are currently translating the maps into English.
* Interactive Visualization: Using Plotly.express, the translated maps are presented in an interactive format, making it easier for players to find their way around.
* Hosting: The English maps are hosted on GitHub for easy access and download.
